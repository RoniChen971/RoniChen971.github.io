    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
    Aye is a breakthrough in how people prove who they are online.<br><br>
    Today’s internet is full of scams, fake profiles, and security breaches - and even multi-factor authentication (MFA) is no longer enough.<br>
    Traditional logins are outdated. MFA is clunky, hackable, and built for a digital world that no longer exists.<br><br>

    <b>We’re not just replacing passwords. We’re replacing the entire mindset.</b><br><br>

    At Aye, we envision a digital world where trust is continuous, identity is secure, and fraud is a thing of the past.<br>
    We believe every person deserves to move through the digital world freely - without fear of impersonation, breaches, or complex logins.<br><br>

    That’s why we’ve built a new kind of Digital ID - a living identity that constantly adapts to who you are, where you are, and how you behave.<br><br>

    <b>It’s not what you remember. It’s who you are.</b><br>
    That’s the new standard of trust.<br><br>

    Aye combines biometric precision, real-time behavioral analysis, and privacy-first intelligence to create an always-on identity that can’t be faked.<br>
    It doesn’t authenticate you once. It keeps you authenticated - live, in motion, and continuously verified.<br><br>

    We are building the next-generation authentication infrastructure for businesses, governments, and financial platforms:<br>
    a system that replaces outdated MFA and login credentials with seamless, real-time identity.<br><br>

    And on top of this infrastructure, we’re creating a powerful B2C platform:<br>
    a personal digital ID that individuals can use to prove who they are in online transactions, protect themselves from scams, and establish real trust in digital spaces.<br><br>

    From enterprise security to everyday interactions -<br>
    <b>Aye is building a safer internet, one verified identity at a time.</b>

    <h2>How Aye Works</h2>
<p>
Aye replaces outdated logins with something far more natural: <b>you.</b><br><br>
No more passwords. No more codes.<br>
Aye recognizes your identity using a unique combination of biometric, behavioral, and contextual signals - in real time.<br><br>

Our system verifies you through:<br>
  <p>
    <img src="logo.png" class="bullet-icon"> <b>Biometrics</b> - your face and voice<br>
    <img src="logo.png" class="bullet-icon"> <b>Behavioral patterns</b> - how you hold, move, and interact with your device<br>
    <img src="logo.png" class="bullet-icon"> <b>Contextual cues</b> - location, environment, and time<br>
    <img src="logo.png" class="bullet-icon"> <b>Adaptive questioning</b> - dynamic challenges based on your usage
  </p>
You don’t need to remember anything. You don’t even need to do anything.<br><br>

<b>Your identity becomes your key - silently, continuously, and securely.</b><br><br>

Aye doesn’t just verify you once - it keeps you verified as long as you’re truly present,<br>
and revokes access the moment something feels off.<br><br>

<b>Aye isn’t just more secure. It’s a better experience.</b><br>
One that works for humans - not against them.
